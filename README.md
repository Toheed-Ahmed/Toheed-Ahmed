## 💡 **About Me**

I’m Toheed Ahmed, an undergraduate software engineer and passionate frontend developer who thrives on transforming ideas into sleek, user-friendly websites. I specialize in building responsive, accessible, and interactive interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

As a natural team player and emerging tech leader, I enjoy taking initiative, collaborating on creative solutions, and staying ahead of the curve in web development trends. Whether it’s leading a student project or building a clean, high-performance UI, I’m driven by curiosity, consistency — and a good cup of coffee .
